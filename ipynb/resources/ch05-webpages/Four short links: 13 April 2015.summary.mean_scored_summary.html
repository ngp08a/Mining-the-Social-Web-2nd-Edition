    <body><p><strong>The Great Reversal in the Demand for Skill and Cognitive Tasks (PDF) -- The only difference with more conventional models of skill-biased technological change is our modelling of the fruits of cognitive employment as creating a stock instead of a pure flow.</strong> <strong>This slight change causes technological change to generate a boom and bust cycle, as is common in most investment models.</strong> <strong>We also incorporated into this model a standard selection process whereby individuals sort into occupations based on their comparative advantage.</strong> The selection process is the key mechanism that explains why a reduction in the demand for cognitive tasks, which are predominantly filled by higher educated workers, can result in a loss of employment concentrated among lower educated workers. While we do not claim that our model is the only structure that can explain the observations we present, we believe it gives a very simple and intuitive explanation to the changes pre- and post-2000. 
 provinces -- state and province lists for (some) countries. 
 Cultural Analytics -- the use of computational and visualization methods for the analysis of massive cultural data sets and flows. Interesting visualisations as well as automated understandings. 
 The Code is Just the Symptom -- The engineering culture was a three-layer cake of dysfunction, where everyone down the chain had to execute what they knew to be an impossible task, at impossible speeds, perfectly. It was like the games of Simon Says and Telephone combined to bad effect. Most engineers will have flashbacks at these descriptions. Trigger warning: candid descriptions of real immature software organisations.</p></body>
