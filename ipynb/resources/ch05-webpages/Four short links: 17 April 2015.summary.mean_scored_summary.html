    <body><p><strong>Replicating SQLite using Raft Consensus -- clever, he used a consensus algorithm to build a distributed (replicated) SQLite.</strong> 
 <strong>When Open Access is the Norm, How do Scientists Communicate?</strong> (PLOS) -- From interviews I’ve conducted with researchers and software developers who are modeling aspects of modern online collaboration, I’ve highlighted the most useful and reproducible practices. (via Jon Udell ) 
 Meet DJ Patil -- “It was this kind of moment when you realize: ‘Oh, my gosh, I am that stupid,’” he said. 
 <strong>Interview with Bruce Sterling on the Convergence of Humans and Machines -- If you are a human being, and you are doing computation, you are trying to multiply 17 times five in your head.</strong> <strong>It feels like thinking.</strong> Machines can multiply, too. They must be thinking. They can do math and you can do math. But the math you are doing is not really what cognition is about. Cognition is about stuff like seeing, maneuvering, having wants, desires. Your cat has cognition. <strong>Cats cannot multiply 17 times five.</strong> They have got their own umwelt (environment). But they are mammalian, you are a mammalian. They are actually a class that includes you. <strong>You are much more like your house cat than you are ever going to be like Siri.</strong> <strong>You and Siri converging, you and your house cat can converge a lot more easily.</strong> You can take the imaginary technologies that many post-human enthusiasts have talked about, and you could afflict all of them on a cat. Every one of them would work on a cat. The cat is an ideal laboratory animal for all these transitions and convergences that we want to make for human beings. (via Vaughan Bell )</p></body>
