 Giving Robots and Prostheses the Human Touch -- the team, led by mechanical engineer Veronica J. Santos, is constructing a language of touch that both a computer and a human can understand. The researchers are quantifying this with mechanical touch sensors that interact with objects of various shapes, sizes, and textures. <strong>Using an array of instrumentation, Santos’ team is able to translate that interaction into data a computer can understand.</strong> The data is used to create a formula or algorithm that gives the computer the ability to identify patterns among the items it has in its library of experiences and something it has never felt before. This research will help the team develop artificial haptic intelligence, which is, essentially, giving robots, as well as prostheses, the “human touch.”

 Everything We Wish We'd Known About Building Data Products (DJ Patil and RusJan Belkin) -- Data is super messy, and data cleanup will always be literally 80% of the work. In other words, data is the problem. <strong>[...] "If you're not thinking about how to keep your data clean from the very beginning, you're fucked.</strong> I guarantee it." [...] “Every single company I've worked at and talked to has the same problem without a single exception so far — poor data quality, especially tracking data,” he says.“Either there's incomplete data, missing tracking data, duplicative tracking data.” To solve this problem, you must invest a ton of time and energy monitoring data quality. You need to monitor and alert as carefully as you monitor site SLAs. You need to treat data quality bugs as more than a first priority. <strong>Don’t be afraid to fail a deploy if you detect data quality issues.</strong></p></body>
